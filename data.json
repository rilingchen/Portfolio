Indigenous chef Jared Qwustenuxun Williams maps the processes involved in preparing traditional foods that is lost in modern food production supply chains. We are increasingly disconnected from where our food comes from, and how it is prepared. This understanding is central to building reciprocal relationships with our land – knowing how it nourishes us, and how we can care for it. This building challenges the detached food supply chain by combining the processes of growing, harvesting, teaching, storing, and eating under a single roof. From the exterior, the three peaks evoke the merging of two single-family gable homes nestled within a spontaneous and cultivated landscape. While the building begins as a food bank, it evolves into a food hub and cultural center over its projected 100 year lifespan.","images":["0 _DSC0580.png","01 250208 Axo-Lifecycle-01.png","230721 Context Plan-01.png","230728_Programming Diagrams-02.png","230730 Plan-01.png","230730 Site Plan-01.png","230730 Site Plan-2.png","230731 Food Supply Chain-01.png","230731 Food Supply Chain-02.png","230731 Long Section-01.png","250208 Axo-01.png","Atrium.png","Connection.png","Diagram-RE-SummerDay.png","Diagram-RE-SummerNight.png","Diagram-StackEffect.png","Elevation-North.png","IMG_6410.jpg","_DSC0601.png"]},"project3":{"title":"Moving Cities","courseName":"","collaborators":"","category":"experiments","description":"Moving Cities is a photobook compiling the photos I’ve taken between 2017 to 2022, with a Nikon dslr.  This camera has been my companion as I have travelled the world visiting different cities. It captures the moments in time that were beautiful or interesting to me. As I look back on these photos which span five years and three continents, I’ve noticed common themes that permeate them. What compelled me to capture this moment? Spanning from North America, Asia and Europe, this series of photos propose the questions: what is it that moves us and what is it that makes a city move? It reveals the characters, buildings and atmospheres of a city which are always changing from one moment to the next.

After it’s decommision, the linear runway sits empty, as a gash in the ground, surrounded by isolated neighbourhoods that are like archipelagos.This empty land has become the subject of intense speculation, specifically for condo developments. These large-scale, top-down plans, lead to homogenous ownership models and typologies which deter social diversity.Our scheme poses the question, how can we build incrementally? At the urban scale, we reevaluate the rectilinear property lines that underlay the majority of Toronto’s fabric, and systems of ownership. These ownership models, lend to smaller scale building typologies, which create more personal, related communities. At the individual scale, each unit is flexible and equipped with plumbing and electrical fixtures but no interior finishing, with the intention that the space will be customized per resident.","images":["0 ezgif.com-animated-gif-maker (4).gif","241202 Riling - After Ext Render.png","241202 Riling - Before Ext Render.png","241213 Ownership Diagram-01 - Copy.jpg","241213 Ownership Diagram-01.jpg","241213 Ownership Diagram-02 - Copy.jpg","241213 Ownership Diagram-02.jpg","AXO FINAL.png","ezgif.com-animated-gif-maker (3).gif","JC_before n after.png","JC_before.png","Landscape Perspective.jpg","Ownership-01.jpg","Ownership-02.jpg","PeterAfter.png","PeterBefore.png","Refined-Kathy-After.png","Refined-Kathy-Before.png"]},"project6":{"title":"Bloom","courseName":"Biomimetic Design Lab","collaborators":"Chiun Lee, Annie Wang","category":"objects","description":"A fern leaf curls in times of drought to conserve moisture. An oxalis folds down at night and opens up when it is bright. This repertoire of movements in nature are a response to an external stimuli like light, touch or changes in temperature and humidity. Instead of mechanics, plants rely on their unique geometry and changes in turgor pressure to drive movements necessary for their survival. Learning from the natural world, we designed Bloom, a self-actuating pavilion that would rely on its geometry and an external stimulus rather than motors or mechanics to activate movement. Our source of inspiration was the common milkweed.","images":["VID_20201022_014946.mp4"]},"project7":{"title":"wareHouse","courseName":"ARC3015 Option Studio","collaborators":"","category":"spaces","description":"","images":["251210 AXO-01.jpg","251212 SECTION PERSPECTIVE-01.jpg","251214 FLOOR PLAN - 2nd - 1-200-01.jpg","251214 FLOOR PLAN - GF - 1-200-01.jpg","251216 Site Plan-01.jpg","251216 UNIT PLAN-1-100-01.jpg","RENDER1-TEST4.png","RENDER2-TEST2.png"]}}
